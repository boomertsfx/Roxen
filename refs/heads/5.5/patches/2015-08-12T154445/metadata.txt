Multiple fixes:

  * Moved last_garb timestamp from module variable to external state file.
    
    This removes the need of calling save() and thus update the config
    file after each garb run.

  * Fix testsuite issue reported in [bug 7520].

  * Loader: Reverse the packages search order.
    
    This is in preparation of fixing [bug 7530], and has the effect
    that the first entry in the package directory search path always
    is "$LOCALDIR".

  * Loader: lopen() et all now use roxen_path().
    
    This should cause eg the RSA certificate action to once again
    create the files where it expects them to be.
    
    Fixes [bug 7530].

  * Branding: Support sitebuilder being a package.
