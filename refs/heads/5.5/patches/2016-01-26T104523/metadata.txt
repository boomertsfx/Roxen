Multiple fixes:

  * SSL: Enable the cipher strength selector in recent Pike 7.8.
    
    Fixes issue with RC4 suites being available by default.

  * SSL: More cipher strength fixes.
    
    The get_suites() API differs between Pike 7.8 and 8.0.
    
    The removed symbol preferred_rsa_suites was replaced by a getter, so it
    isn't a suitable symbol to use to detect the presence of get_suites().

  * SSL: Updated cipher strength documentation.

  * SSL: Added some ROXEN_SSL_DEBUG.
    
    This #define can be used to enable some high-level SSL debug.
