Multiple fixes:

  * SNMP: Added SNMP name space for _disable_threads().
    New pike needed to make it work.

  * Cache manager_size_overhead when entries aren't added.
    
    The overhead will be recomputed when the number of added entries
    since the last computation is above 10% of the total number of
    entries in the cache.
