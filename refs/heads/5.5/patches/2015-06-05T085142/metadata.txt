Multiple fixes:

  * Testsuite: Added some minimal testing of <wash-html>.
    
    Fixes [bug 7499].

  * SNMP: Added SNMP name space for _disable_threads().

  * Version bumped to 5.5.97 by buildsystem.

  * Cache manager_size_overhead when entries aren't added.
    
    The overhead will be recomputed when the number of added entries since the last
    computation is above 10% of the total number of entries in the cache.
