• insert#href: Don't destruct Query object prematurely.

This could lead to lookup in destructed object if the query didn't
return any data (possibly because the other party closed the connection).
RT#28704.

• PatchPatch: Survive more failure conditions.

Don't abort patch installation with an internal server error due
to permission issues and similar.

Fixes remainder of [WS-34].
