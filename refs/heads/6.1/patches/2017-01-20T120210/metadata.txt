• [session tag] Fixed failure to set session cookie

There was a case error in the set cookie that made the session tag
completely broken. Noted in [roxen.com#28166].

• Modify log timestamps to always print absolute time, and to display uptime
every 5 lines. [WS-4]

• Improve cross-referencing of thread IDs in mutex _sprintf() by
resolving the thread name.

• git-rxnpatch: Generate release sync clusters for all releases.

Previously a release sync cluster was only generated for the latest
release if there were patches for it.

Fixes issue where the meta cluster for Roxen 5.4.94-r3 contained
sync patches intended for Roxen 5.4.88-r2. This was due to the
sync clusters 5.4.88-5.4.94 not having been generated, and the
sync patches having ended up in the generic cluster.

Fixes [IS-26].

• git-rxnpatch: Added cluster --force.

Make it possible to generate a new cluster even if the current one
seems up to date. This is needed for some old branches to generate
the the release-specific clusters if they are missing.
