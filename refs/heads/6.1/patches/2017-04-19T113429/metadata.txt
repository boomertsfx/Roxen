Multiple fixes:

• git-rxnpatch: More fixes to the ident verifier.

• reCAPTCHA: Changed how you configure named key pairs.

We now instead prefix the Site Key with "name #".

• reCAPTCHA: Added support for named key pairs.

If many different reCAPTCHA configurations are used it's virtually impossible to tell which is which. Thus it's now possible to name a configuration and then reference that configuration by its name in the tag attributes.

• reCAPTCHA: Fixed some typos.

• Recaptcha: Show API error codes with RECAPTCHA_DEBUG

• Recaptcha: Censor secret attribute

Also altered attribute checking logic slightly.

• Recaptcha: Proper labels for key pars setting

• RXML.Value: Support nested scopes in rxml_var_eval().

rxml_var_eval() failed to store the evaluation result when
evaluating in nested scopes with "Unknown scope "foo.bar".".

Fixes remainder of [WS-33].

• RXML.Context: Support dotted scope_name in parse_user_var().

In some circumstances (like eg RXML.Value()->rxml_var_eval()) dot-separated
scopes may show up, so make sure that we support them.

Fixes some of [WS-33].
