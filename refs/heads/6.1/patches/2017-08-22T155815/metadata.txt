• <ldap/>, <emit#ldap/>: Support specifying TLS implementation level.

Adds support for the attributes max-tls and min-tls.

Fixes [WS-51].

• RXML: Document the "base64url" encoding.

This encoding was undocumented.

• RXML: Remove line feeds from the "base64" encoding.

RFC 4648 3.1 requires that base64 encodings must not add line feeds
unless specifically directed to do so.

Adds encoding "base64mime" with the old behavior (ie enforcing
a maximum line length of 76 characters).

CAVEAT EMPTOR: This change of behavior is incompatible with older
versions of Roxen.

Fixes [WS-43].

• RoxenPatch: Fixed HTTPS URL validation check.

The wrong URL was checked...

• PoxenPatch: Request and check cluster checksums.

The automatic download of patch clusters now checks that the
cluster files haven't been corrupted (ie usually truncated)
during download.

Fixes some of [WS-49].
