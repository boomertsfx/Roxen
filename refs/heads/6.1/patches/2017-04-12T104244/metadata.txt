• Added new tag module recaptcha.pike

This module only contains an if (if#recaptcha-verify) tag that verifies a recaptcha response against Google's verification service.

• HTTPClient: Added content-length header (if missing) if method is POST.

The underlying Pike API doesn't seem to add the content-length automatically if it's not explicitly set. Some services requires it to be set to accept the (POST) request.
