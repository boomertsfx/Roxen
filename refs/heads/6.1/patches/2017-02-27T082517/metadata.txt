• Host Redirect: Fixed variable documentation

Example rules was illegible and mixed v1 and v2 syntax capabilities.
Cant' believe it has been like this for almost 10 years.

• Index files only: Don't redirect to internal path

If the request has been redirected internally, don't expose the internal
path to the browser when making the redirect to add a trailing slash to
the URL. [roxen.com #28397]

• RoxenPatch: Use a version-dependent tmp directory for patch clusters.

Fixes some of [WS-10].

• Insert cached href: Documented new attributes

• Insert cached href: Added support for custom request-headers

• REQUEST_DEBUG: Improved robustness against destructed RequestID.

Fixes [WS-18].
