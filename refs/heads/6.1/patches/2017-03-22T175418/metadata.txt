Multiple fixes:

• CGI [Pike 8.0]: Fix parsing of header block.

If the first block of data received from a script exceeded
MAXHEADERLEN (32769 bytes) the module would complain about
excessive headers without ever searching for the header separator.

Fixes [Bug 7829]

• Host Redirect: Updated default ignore paths for new editor
