• Fixed type of non-constant variable expression.

• htaccess: Improved support for relative paths.

The AuthUserFile and AuthGroupFile directives now support
relative paths properly.

Fixes [WS-176]/[WS-174].

• VFS.find_above_read: Set the extend_entries option for the cache.

The cache system assumes that entries won't be regenerated if
there was a cache hit. VFS.find_above_read() refreshes the cache
entry regardless of whether cache_lookup() had a hit or not.

This fixes warnings from the cache system about calling cache_set()
without a prior cache_lookup().

Fixes [WS-175]/[WS-174].
