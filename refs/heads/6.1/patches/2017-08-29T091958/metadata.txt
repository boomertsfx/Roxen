• git-rxnpatch: Fixed some option name typos.

The --path-remap-rule option should now work.

Fixes [WS-58] some more.

• git-rxnpatch: Add support for filename remapping.

The "make" command now rewrites relevant parts of the generated diffs
to support remapping of filenames.

Fixes remainder of [WS-58].

• git-rxnpatch: Added option --path-remap-rule.

This option is used to edit the path_remapping_rules.txt file.

It will in turn be used to perform custom remapping of files to
handle files that have been moved by the build system.

Fixes some of [WS-58].
