• Silence debug warning for <use>.

• <cache>: Fixed error leaving stale content in RAM cache

Wrong key was used when removing entries from "RXML <cache>
alternatives", causing alternatives from old Frame objects to never be
removed.

Also moved the removal to a call_out to avoid locking problems since we
are inside a destroy().

• RAM Cache: Adjusted debug message in cache_remove()

• Admin Interface [DB Browser]: Handle removed configurations

Make sure configuration exists before trying to load it so we can
complain about deleted sites.
