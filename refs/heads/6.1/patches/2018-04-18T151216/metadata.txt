• Static resource server: Added support for URL:s with anchor or query string.

This is necessary if you want to use <server-static-resources> on SVGs with symbols:

  <svg>
    <use xlink:href="/my/sprite.svg#my-symbol" />
  </svg>

• DBManager: stop backup thread when Roxen exits.

# Conflicts:
#	server/etc/modules/DBManager.pmod

• DBManager: perform backups in a dedicated thread.

This avoids blocking the background_run thread. Fixes WS-204.
