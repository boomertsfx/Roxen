• RXML Tags: No internal path for relative redirects

If request was internally redirected when encountering a relative
<redirect/> the internal path would previously be exposed to the
browser. Fixes [WS-26].

• Host Redirect: Fixed internal redirects combined with %p

Don't strip trailing slash when added by %p for internal redirects.
