• Don't try to count ints and floats to PCode entry size

• Also exempt Tag objects when calculating PCode entry size

Since they are global objects referenced from many PCode objects.

• Don't add RXML.Type objects size to calculated PCode size

When objects like RXML.t_html(text/html, xml) was added to the
calculated size of PCode objects it could inflate the numbers by up to
several MB per object.

• JS and CSS cache busting [CMS-205]

• Removed trailing spaces.

• Redirect Module [CMS-274]:

Added support for redirect files accessible from Roxen's virtual file
system. For example for redirect files residing in SiteBuilder or in a
File system module.

• Redirect Module ("abstraction rewrite") [CMS-274]:

Preparing for new feature: support for redirect files accessible from
Roxen's virtual file system.

• Start script: Add option --mysql-only.

This is an option used to start/stop the embedded MySQL/MariaDB
without also starting Roxen.

Fixes [WS-71].

• create_configif: Some minor interface cleanup.

Fixes remainder of [WS-69].

• create_configif: Improved defaults on interactive redo.

The previously configured values are now used as defaults
the second time around if the user failed to confirm them.

Fixes some more of [WS-69].

• create_configif: Support --batch without any value pairs.

Fixes even more of [WS-69].

• create_configif: Don't create a user in --batch mode if no password.

Fixes some more of [WS-69].

• create_configif: Fixed confirmation test in --batch mode.

Using --batch without specifying a value for ok should now work.

Fixes some of [WS-69].

• create_configif: Improved XML formatting somewhat.

• create_configif: Improved --batch mode.

Previously it was necessary to list all settings for --batch
(also those that have defaults) to avoid interactive queries.

Setting the batch setting "ok" to "n" now causes interactive
confirmation. Previously it caused an infinite loop.

The batch setting "server_url" now defaults to "https://*:22202/"
as per tradition.

The server url protocol setting now defaults to "https".

The settings confirmation check is now case insensitive.
