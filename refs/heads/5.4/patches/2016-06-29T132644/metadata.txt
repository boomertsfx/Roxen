Multiple fixes:

  * RXML: Added attribute accept-status to <insert#href/>.
    
    This attribute allows for finer-grained error handling and for
    retreiving the received data also for error statuses.
    
    Fixes [bug 7554].

  * Redirects: Improved quoting of redirect headers.
    
    Ensure that the location header is quoted properly.
    
    Fixes [bug 7737].

  * Roxen.make_http_headers: Validate the argument.
    
    Fixes the entire class of bugs that [bug 7737] represents.
