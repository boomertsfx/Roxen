Multiple fixes:

  * Filesystem: Improved path normalization.
    
    Make sure that the cached search path ends with a directory separator.
    
    Fixes errors on NT (where roxen_path() strips the separator).

  * Filesystem: Added wrapper for System.normalize_path().
    
    Potential fix for more issues on NT.

  * Filesystem: Improved wrapper for normalize_path().
    
    Attempt to handle the case where the entire path is invalid.
    
    Potential fix for more issues on NT.

  * Filesystem [NT]: More path normalization fixes.

  * Filesystem: Adjusting id->not_query is not a good idea.
    
    The path given to low_real_path() doesn't necessarily have
    any relation to id->not_query...
    
    For some reason this triggered testsuite failures only on NT.
