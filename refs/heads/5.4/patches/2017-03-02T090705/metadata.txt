• Host Redirect: Fixed variable documentation

Example rules was illegible and mixed v1 and v2 syntax capabilities.


• Index files only: Don't redirect to internal path

If the request has been redirected internally, don't expose the internal
path to the browser when making the redirect to add a trailing slash to
the URL.
