Multiple fixes:

  * Testsuite: Added some minimal testing of <wash-html>.
    
    Fixes [bug 7499].

  * SNMP: Added SNMP name space for _disable_threads().

  * Moved last_garb timestamp from module variable to external state file.
    
    This removes the need of calling save() and thus update the config
    file after each garb run.
