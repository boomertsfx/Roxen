Multiple fixes:

  * Tracing: Added missing TRACE_LEAVE().

  * Directories: Fixed broken redirect on empty lock file.

  * Locale: LC_ALL should override all other locale settings.
    
    Fixes [bug 7559].

  * RXML: Added cleaup() to TagCache.
    
    This moves unlocking of the cache mutex to the cleanup phase of RXML
    parsing. This means that the mutex will be released also when errors
    are thrown during evaluation of the content to be cached.
    
    Potential fix for [bug 7565].
