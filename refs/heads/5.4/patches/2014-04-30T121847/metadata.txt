Multiple fixes:

  * Version bumped to 5.4.67 by buildsystem.

  * Version bumped to 5.4.68 by buildsystem.

  * RoxenPatch: Fix pike version deps on WIN32.
    
    For some reason the installation location of the version.h header file
    for Pike differs on WIN32. We now check that location if there's no
    file at the primary location.
    
    Fixes [bug 7101].

  * LOG_GC_TIMESTAMPS: Reduce default verbosity.
    
    Hide "GC cyclic reference in %O." behind LOG_GC_VERBOSE.

  * LOG_GC_TIMESTAMPS: The histogram is no longer accumulative.
    
    The local gc behaviour is usually more interesting than the global.
