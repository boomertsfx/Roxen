  * DBs: Restore SIGPIPE signal handler after creating Mysql connections.
    
    The low-level mysql client code zaps the SIGPIPE handler,
    so we need to restore it.
    
    Work-around for [bug 7582].
    
    Proper potential fix requires new Pike binary.

  * DBs: Fixed typo in restoration of SIGPIPE signal handler.
