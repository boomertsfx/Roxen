Multiple fixes:

  * <translate/>: Complain about missing required attributes.
    
    Fixes some of [bug 7592].

  * Version bumped to 5.4.92 by buildsystem.

  * SSL: Avoid setting the minimum version higher than supported.
    
    A patched Roxen 5.x may have a more recent SSL modules than pike binary.
    This makes TLS 1.1 and 1.2 symbols available even though not supported
    with the old pike binary. Instead look at PROTOCOL_TLS_MAX which is
    the actual maximum supported version.

  * Version bumped to 5.4.93 by buildsystem.
