Multiple fixes:

  * Configuration: Got rid of the Priority objects.
    
    Instead of keeping track of the modules in a hard-coded multi-level
    priority forrest, they are now kept in a single proprity-sorted array.
    This will later allow for supporting more module priority levels than 10.
    
    Fixes some of [bug 7611].

  * Configuration: Cleaned up and unified the module lookup code.
    
    Most of the module lookup caches are now initialized with the data
    returned from low_module_lookup().

  * Configuration: Update the api_module_cache on module removal.
    
    Stale data was retained in the api_module_cache when modules were removed.

  * Hilfe: Removed support for debug("accesses").
    
    Getting this feature to work with the new module priority system is
    non-trivial, and I haven't ever heard about anyone using the feature.

  * Configuration: Minor change.

  * Variable.Variable: Added support for encode/decode.
    
    These two functions can be used to override the default verbatim
    encoding of configuration variable values.

  * Documentation: Added some Autodoc markup for store().

  * Variable: Added new variable type Priority.
    
    This variable type is intended to later be used to handle module priorities.

  * Modules: Use Variable.Priority to handle module priorities.
    
    Preparation for fixing [bug 7611].

  * Configuration: Added configurable maximum module priority.
    
    Fixes [bug 7611].

  * Config IF: Support new maximum priorities in Module Priorities tab.

  * Config IF: Location modules are also affected by priorities.

  * Fix regression in location_modules() where entries with same priority weren't
    returned in order of decreasing prefix length.

  * ConfigIF: Use a selector for priority range 0-9.

  * ConfigIF: Put the new module priority system behind ENABLE_NEW_PRIO.
    
    This is a preparation to enable backporting of the new module
    priority system to Roxen 5.4 et al and still have minimal
    impact when not enabled.
    
    Note that the priority variable is still changed to a Variable.Priority.
    
    Fixes some of [bug 7662].

  * RXML: Don't leak recorded changes to surrounding scopes when evaling PCode.
    
    Fixes [RT #25739].

  * Version bumped to 5.4.96 by buildsystem.

  * ConfigIF: Fixed typo in #ifdef.
    
    The enabling #define for the new module priority system is
    ENABLE_NEW_PRIO, NOT ENABLE_MAX_PRIO.
    
    Fixes altering of the maximum priority levels when
    ENABLE_NEW_PRIO is active.
