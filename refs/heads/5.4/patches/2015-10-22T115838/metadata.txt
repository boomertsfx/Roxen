Multiple fixes:

  * DBs: Fixed backup schedule buttons.
    
    "New" and "Delete" were broken due to the difference between
    <submit-gbutton/> and <submit-gbutton2/>.
    
    "Cancel" was broken due to some browsers ignoring href="" since
    the attribute was empty...

  * DBs: Unlink any databases from the schedule before deleting it.

  * DBs: Fixed unlinking of deleted backup schedules.

  * I/O: Make sure to ignore SIGPIPE.
    
    Under some circumstances Stdio.sendfile() will use blocking I/O.
    If the other end then closes the connection before all data is
    sent sendfile() will fail with EPIPE and kill us with SIGPIPE.
    We don't want to die...
    
    Fixes some of [bug 7582].
