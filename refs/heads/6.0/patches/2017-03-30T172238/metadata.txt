• RoxenPatch: The installation log file is now in UTF-8.

Fixes backtraces when attempting to write wide characters to
the installation log.

Fixes [WS-29].

• git-rxnpatch: More fixes for release sync clusters.

Fixes issue where derived patches could generate sync clusters
between the same version (causing an infinite loop later when
generating meta clusters).

• git-rxnpatch: Generate release sync clusters for all releases.

Previously a release sync cluster was only generated for the latest
release if there were patches for it.

Fixes issue where the meta cluster for Roxen 5.4.94-r3 contained
sync patches intended for Roxen 5.4.88-r2. This was due to the
sync clusters 5.4.88-5.4.94 not having been generated, and the
sync patches having ended up in the generic cluster.

Fixes [IS-26].

• git-rxnpatch: Added cluster --force.

Make it possible to generate a new cluster even if the current one
seems up to date. This is needed for some old branches to generate
the the release-specific clusters if they are missing.

• git-rxnpatch: Improved diagnostics.

• git-rxnpatch: Minor code clean up.

• git-rxnpatch: Don't attempt to cat the empty blob.

• RoxenPatch: New files may now force overwrites.

This is needed in order to support "blind" patches.

Fixes some of [is-13].

• git-rxnpatch: Log failed git command

• Read author info from environment

• git-rxnpatch: Identify patch clusters by the most recent patch.

• git-rxnpatch: Fixed name of release clusters.

• git-rxnpatch: Create separate clusters for different releases.

Preparation for [IS 6].

• git-rxnpatch: Moved parsing of metadata.txt to a separate function.

• git-rxnpatch [cluster]: Some code cleanup.

Prepare for making several clusters.

Preparations for [IS 6].

• git-rxnpatch: Fixed multiple issues with the ident verifier.

* Fixed typo in git command.

* Remap the dist paths to repository paths.

• git-rxnpatch: Fixed multiple patch message.

• git-rxnpatch: Validate $Id$ expansions.

Potential fix for [bug 7822].

• git-rxnpatch: Added option --subject for subcommand "new".

--subject now sets the subject for the new patch, while
--message sets the description (previously the subject).

This should be less confusing.
