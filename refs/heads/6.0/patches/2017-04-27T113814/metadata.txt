• git-rxnpatch: Workaround for git-diff quoting bug.

git-diff doesn't quote filenames containing spaces.

Adds some heuristics to work around the problem.

Fixes some of [IS-35].

• Loader: Move Privs to roxenloader.

This makes it available to modules loaded during compilation of Roxen
(like eg RoxenPatch).

Fixes [WS-35] and some of [WS-32] and [WS-34].

• RAM Cache: Aligned accounting code with 6.1

This is a combination of commit 1201f57 and f0dcaaa, but does not change
much in practice.

• git-rxnpatch: More fixes to the ident verifier.

* Don't complain about ourselves...

* Fixes building of patch 2017-03-30T172238.
