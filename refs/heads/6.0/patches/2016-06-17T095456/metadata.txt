  * Version bumped to 6.0.135 by buildsystem.

  * RXML: &page.post-data; should evaluate to RXML.nil when no post-data.
    
    The HTTP protocol module has a tendency to set data to "" (and not to 0),
    even when no data was submitted with the request. Detect this case by
    checking whether id->misc->len has been set (ie a Content-Length header
    was received).
    
    Fixes [bug 7721].
