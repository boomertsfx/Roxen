Multiple fixes:

  * relay2.pike: No check was made for the existense of from->prot_obj (which could be missing) which could lead to an indexing the NULL value error.

  * relay2: Actually port_obj was misspelled as prot_obj.

  * Installer [Win32]: Prefer MariaDB 10.1 to MariaDB 10.0.
    
    Potential fix for [bug 7705] (and possibly [bug 7698]).

  * Extensions: *.gz and *.bz2 et al are content-types.
    
    *.gz and *.bz2 et al are now treated as content-types and
    not as content-encodings.
    
    Fixes issues with browsers inflating downloaded files.
    
    See also RFC 6713.
    
    Fixes [bug 7691].

  * RXML [Help]: Fixed tag name quoting on non-existing tag.
    
    Thanks to Henry Umansky <humansky@princeton.edu> for the report.
    
    Fixes [bug 7707].
