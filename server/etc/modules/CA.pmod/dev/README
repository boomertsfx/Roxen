This is the start of the implementation of an ACME client in Pike/Roxen.

You will need a Pike with Crypto.Sign.State()->jwk().

The initial goal is to implement the ACME standard where Boulder behaves
according to the standard since the primary objective is to provide an
integration with Let's Encrypt. Once Let's Encrypt supports the ACME standard
it should be a minimal effort to replace Boulder specific stuff with the
corresponding ACME implementation.

At the current state of this module it has no actual integration with Roxen,
and can be seen as a completly standalone Pike module.

The `test.pike` script can be used when developing this module.
